# Bitcoin: Satoshi (Unit) needs a symbol

# Challenge: No general consensus yet

* Samourai removed USD denomination
* Lightning is coming, micro transactions will be a thing

## BTC price forecast
calculate USD inflation and new money printed

It's reasonable to expect BTC to go up to 100k USD by 2022.

## Examples for micro transactions:

1 BTC = 100k USD:

0.19 USD = 190sat = 1.9 bits
0.39 USD = 390sat = 3.9 bits
0.99 USD = 990sat  = 9.9 bits
4.99 USD = 4990sat 49.90 bits
9.99 USD = 9990sat = 99.99 bits

1 BTC = 1mio USD:

In this scenario 1 bit = 1 USD makes everything easier

0.19 USD = 19sat = 0.19 bits
0.39 USD = 39sat = 0.39 bits
0.99 USD = 99sat  = 0.99 bits
4.99 USD = 499sat = 4.99 bits
9.99 USD = 999sat = 9.99 bits

# Examples from other currencies and units

1€ = 100 ¢
$1 = 100 ¢
1¥ = 100

1. how to get the symbol to keyboard without the industry adopting it into a standard. maybe just typing sat should be enough.
2.
