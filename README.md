# Bitcoin: Satoshi (Unit) needs a symbol

Tldr: BTC has a symbol, sat not yet.
When BTC hits 100k USD and Lightning is adopted, satoshis will become a viable denomination when handling BTC payments.

# Challenge: No general consensus yet

# Why sat needs its own symbol

http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/
BTC was added to unicode standard

## Closed ecosystem is the ultimate goal

* Samourai removed USD denomination
* Lightning is coming, micro transactions will be a thing

**Building a habit early on for users to think in satoshis**

# Compatibility with other BIPs

## BTC price forecast
calculate USD inflation and new money printed

It's reasonable to expect BTC to go up to 100k USD by 2022.

## Examples for micro transactions:

Use cases for sat denomination:

* Ingame transactions for items
* Content access (text, audio, video)
* Partial content access (e.g. pay per second of consumption)
* Coffee purchase
* Royalty and licensing collection/calculation

1 BTC = 100k USD:
* 0.01 USD = 10sat = 0.1 bits
* 0.19 USD = 190sat = 1.9 bits
* 0.39 USD = 390sat = 3.9 bits
* 0.99 USD = 990sat = 9.9 bits
* 4.99 USD = 4990sat 49.90 bits
* 9.99 USD = 9990sat = 99.90 bits

1 BTC = 1mio USD:

In this scenario 1 bit = 1 USD makes everything easier
* 0.01 USD = 1sat = 0.01 bits
* 0.19 USD = 19sat = 0.19 bits
* 0.39 USD = 39sat = 0.39 bits
* 0.99 USD = 99sat  = 0.99 bits
* 4.99 USD = 499sat = 4.99 bits
* 9.99 USD = 999sat = 9.99 bits

# Historical examples from other currencies and units 

// https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A5 includes currency symbols

* 1€ = 100 ¢
* $1 = 100 ¢
* 1¥ = 100 sen (did not have an intl symbol)

# Existing Proposals

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit)

# Currently existing S based characters and symbols

Characters:

Symbols:

# Requirements

* Internationally understood as a subunit to BTC
* latin character based
* no confusion with other unit symbols


# Proposel symbols

## 1. small s with 3 lines

Good: clear distinction from dollar symbol
Bad: Still looks too similar to dollar symbol

## 2. capital s with a dot above

Good: Not used in any character set
Bad: Does not exist in unicode

# Possible issues with this proposal

1. how to get the symbol to keyboard without the industry adopting it into a standard. maybe just typing sat should be enough.
2.
